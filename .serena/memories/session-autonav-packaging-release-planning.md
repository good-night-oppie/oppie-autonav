# AutoNav Packaging & Release Planning Session Context

**Session Type**: Strategic Planning & Architecture  
**Date**: 2025-09-07  
**Context Type**: Comprehensive Session Summary  
**Checkpoint**: True  
**Priority**: High - Critical for AutoNav implementation

## Executive Summary

Created comprehensive packaging and release plan for oppie-autonav that enables dogfooding (oppie using AutoNav for its own development), strategically aligned with the 14-day helios validation framework and hybrid architecture decisions.

## Strategic Context Preserved

### Helios Validation Framework Integration
- **Timeline**: 14-day empirical validation cycle
- **Success Metric**: `SuccessScore = (is_ci_green * 1.0) - (human_review_minutes / 60.0)`
- **Performance Targets**: 
  - <70μs VST commits
  - 99% I/O reduction validation
- **Risk Controls**: Budget caps, complexity triggers, A/B testing requirements

### Hybrid Architecture Alignment
- **Distribution**: 80% simple tasks (single-loop) + 20% complex (MCTS escalation)
- **Decision Logic**: Complexity-based routing with empirical thresholds
- **Performance Focus**: Optimize for common case, escalate for complexity

### Key Innovation: Self-Improving Development Loop
```
Oppie Development → AutoNav Orchestration → Helios Performance → AutoNav Enhancement → Better Oppie
```

This creates a continuous feedback loop where AutoNav optimizes its own development process.

## Implementation Architecture

### Distribution Strategy
- **Universal Installer**: `curl -sSL https://oppie.xyz/install | bash`
- **Language-Specific Packages**: 
  - `npx oppie-autonav init` (Node.js)
  - `pip install oppie-autonav` (Python)
  - `cargo install oppie-autonav` (Rust)
  - `go install oppie.xyz/autonav` (Go)
- **Container Distribution**: Docker, Podman, Firecracker support
- **Release Channels**: Nightly (dogfooding), Beta, Stable, LTS

### Dogfooding Implementation Stages

#### Stage 1 (Days 1-7): Self-Bootstrap
- AutoNav manages its own helios development
- Initial MCTS parameter tuning
- Basic performance metrics collection

#### Stage 2 (Days 8-14): Full Integration
- AutoNav orchestrates its own development cycle
- Advanced performance optimization
- Helios validation framework completion

#### Stage 3 (Post-validation): Production Dogfooding
- All oppie projects using AutoNav
- Industry deployment preparation
- Continuous self-improvement cycles

### Package Architecture
- **autonav-core**: MCTS orchestration engine + hybrid decision logic
- **autonav-claude**: Enhanced TDD workflows + specialized agents
- **autonav-metrics**: Helios-specific performance monitoring

## Technical Decisions

### Minimal Dependencies Approach
- **Core**: Go stdlib + BLAKE3 cryptography
- **Optional**: Container APIs (Docker, Podman, Firecracker)
- **Plugins**: Language-specific adapters for universal compatibility

### Security & Compliance
- **SLSA**: Supply-chain security compliance
- **Signed Releases**: Cryptographic verification
- **AGPL Audit**: License compliance requirements

### Monitoring & Metrics
- **Real-time KPIs**: Aligned with helios validation metrics
- **Dogfooding Telemetry**: Performance tracking during self-use
- **Success Validation**: Empirical measurement of development acceleration

## Meta-Innovation: Continuous Self-Optimization

AutoNav continuously optimizes its own:
- **MCTS Parameters**: Exploration constants, tree depth optimization
- **Escalation Thresholds**: Dynamic complexity trigger adjustment
- **Resource Allocation**: Container limits, budget optimization
- **Success Metrics**: Custom KPIs per project type

## Success Criteria & Validation

### Short-term (14 days)
- Helios development accelerated using AutoNav
- Empirical validation of MCTS value proposition
- Performance metrics meeting <70μs VST targets

### Medium-term (3 months)
- All oppie projects using AutoNav for development
- 2-3x development velocity improvement
- Validated hybrid architecture approach

### Long-term (1 year)
- Industry-standard autonomous development tool
- Self-improving development cycles
- Proven autonomous coding agent architecture

## Key Deliverables

### Primary Artifact
- **PACKAGING_RELEASE_PLAN.md**: 47-section comprehensive implementation plan
- Detailed technical specifications and rollout strategy
- Aligned with helios validation timeline

### Implementation Roadmap
1. **Immediate**: Begin self-bootstrap implementation
2. **Week 1**: Core packaging and distribution setup
3. **Week 2**: Full dogfooding integration
4. **Post-validation**: Production release preparation

## Strategic Value Proposition

### Empirical Validation Approach
- Uses helios development as real-world validation
- Measures actual performance improvements vs assumptions
- Provides concrete evidence for MCTS architecture value

### Self-Improving Development Loop
- AutoNav manages its own development process
- Creates continuous optimization cycles
- Validates autonomous development agent concepts

### Industry Impact Potential
- First autonomous development tool with self-improvement
- Empirically validated MCTS approach to coding
- Hybrid architecture balancing efficiency and capability

## Context for Future Sessions

### Ready for Implementation
- Plan aligned with 14-day validation cycle
- Technical architecture decisions finalized
- Distribution strategy defined

### Empirical Evidence Focus
- Dogfooding approach provides real performance data
- Helios metrics validate MCTS value proposition
- Self-improvement validates autonomous development

### Risk Mitigation
- All decisions grounded in helios performance requirements
- Budget and complexity controls in place
- A/B testing framework for validation

## Action Items for Next Session

1. Begin implementing self-bootstrap stage
2. Set up core packaging infrastructure
3. Initialize helios development with AutoNav
4. Establish baseline performance metrics
5. Create dogfooding telemetry system
