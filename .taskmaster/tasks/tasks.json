        "description": "Refactor the L2 storage layer to use proper keyspace separation for metadata, replacing the inefficient 'meta:' key prefix to resolve a critical performance issue identified in PR #25.",
        "details": "The current implementation of the L2 content-addressable store uses a simple 'meta:' string prefix for all metadata keys, leading to inefficient prefix scans and potential key collisions. This task will refactor the storage layer to introduce a dedicated namespace for metadata. \n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. **Design a new keyspace model:** Instead of string prefixes, use a more efficient separation mechanism suitable for the underlying key-value store (e.g., separate Column Families in RocksDB, or a binary key structure like `[namespace_id_byte][key]`).\n2. **Refactor Storage Abstraction:** Modify the low-level read/write functions within the CAS (Task 12) to encapsulate the new namespace logic. All consumers of metadata should go through this updated abstraction.\n3. **Develop a Data Migration Script:** Create a standalone, idempotent script to transform existing data. The script must scan for all keys with the 'meta:' prefix, rewrite them into the new namespace format, and safely delete the old keys.\n4. **Integrate and Update Consumers:** Identify and update all parts of the codebase (e.g., Configuration System from Task 25) that currently interact with metadata keys to use the new, abstracted access methods.\n5. **Ensure Transactional Integrity:** The migration process must be atomic or at least resumable to prevent data corruption in case of interruption.",
        "testStrategy": "1. **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for the new key encoding/decoding logic and the updated storage abstraction layer to ensure correctness of the namespace separation.\n2. **Migration Tooling Tests:** Create a test suite for the migration script. Test it against various scenarios: an empty database, a database with only metadata, a mixed data database, and running the script multiple times to verify idempotency.\n3. **Integration Tests:** Verify that systems consuming the metadata (like the Configuration System) continue to function correctly after the refactoring, reading and writing metadata without issue.\n4. **Performance Benchmarks:** Establish a baseline by benchmarking metadata read/write/scan operations with the old 'meta:' prefix. Rerun the same benchmarks after the change to quantify the performance improvement, targeting at least a 50% reduction in scan times.\n5. **Data Integrity Verification:** After migration, run a verification tool that compares a checksum of the migrated data against a checksum of the original data (transformed in memory) to ensure no data was lost or corrupted.",
