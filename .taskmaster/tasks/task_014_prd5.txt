# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement MCTS Engine with Hot-Loop Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Build Monte Carlo Tree Search engine optimized for sub-5-second iterations in hot sandbox environment
# Details:
• Implement core MCTS algorithm (selection, expansion, simulation, backpropagation)
• Build UCB1 selection strategy with configurable exploration constant
• Integrate with hot-loop sandbox for rapid simulations
• Implement parallel rollout execution
• Add progressive widening for large action spaces
• Build node pruning and memory management
• Implement RAVE (Rapid Action Value Estimation)
• Add virtual loss for parallel MCTS
• Create checkpoint and resume functionality
• Build MCTS visualization and debugging tools

# Test Strategy:
• Unit tests for MCTS components
• Integration tests with sandbox environment
• Benchmark iteration time < 5s
• Test convergence on known problems
• Parallel execution correctness tests
