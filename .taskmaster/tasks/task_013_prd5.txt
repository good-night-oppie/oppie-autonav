# Task ID: 13
# Title: Create Multi-Dimensional Reward Function System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Build comprehensive evaluation system with functional, non-functional, infrastructure, and human factors scoring
# Details:
• Define reward function interface and metrics
• Implement functional metrics (test coverage, performance benchmarks)
• Add code quality metrics (complexity, readability scores)
• Build infrastructure cost modeling (cold start, memory, connections)
• Implement token cost tracking and optimization
• Add risk scoring system (CVE scanning, permission analysis)
• Create human review time estimation model
• Implement DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) for weight learning
• Build metric aggregation and normalization
• Add configurable weight profiles for different contexts

# Test Strategy:
• Unit tests for each metric calculation
• Integration tests for reward aggregation
• A/B testing framework for preference learning
• Benchmark metric calculation < 100ms
• Validate metric consistency and reproducibility
