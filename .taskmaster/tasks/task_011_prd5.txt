# Task ID: 11
# Title: Build Hot-Loop Sandbox with Firecracker/gVisor Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create high-performance, memory-level virtualization environment for MCTS exploration with sub-second iteration times
# Details:
• Evaluate and select virtualization technology (Firecracker vs gVisor vs Devcontainer)
• Implement persistent VM pool management
• Create hot-state container provisioning system
• Build sandbox lifecycle management (create, execute, destroy)
• Implement resource isolation and limits
• Add network isolation and security sandboxing
• Create fast file system mounting with overlayfs
• Build sandbox metrics and monitoring
• Implement sandbox pooling for instant availability
• Add crash recovery and automatic restart mechanisms

# Test Strategy:
• Benchmark sandbox creation time < 100ms
• Test resource isolation with stress tests
• Security testing for escape prevention
• Concurrent sandbox execution tests (100+ parallel)
• Memory leak detection and cleanup verification
