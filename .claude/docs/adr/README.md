# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the oppie-autonav project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records capture important architectural decisions made during the development of the project. They help us understand not just *what* we decided, but *why* we made those decisions.
