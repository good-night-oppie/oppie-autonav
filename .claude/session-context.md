# Session Context - MCTS Consolidation Work

## Session Summary
Successfully consolidated copied folders into unified MCTS-focused architecture for oppie-autonav, enabling MCTS Inner cycle simulation with helios snapshot transitions (A → A.1).

## Key Discoveries & Implementations

### 1. MCTS Workflow Integration
Created complete execute-test-backtrack cycle coordinating:
- MCTS Engine → oppie-autonav → Claude Code → Helios Engine → MCTS Learning

### 2. Architecture Components Created
- `.mcts/workflows/helios-snapshot-execution.md` - Core A → A.1 transition workflow  
- `.mcts/workflows/mcts-tdd-integration.md` - TDD integration with MCTS learning
- `.mcts/workflows/mcts-autonav-bridge.sh` - Main coordination script
- `.oppie-hooks/mcts-pre-execution.sh` - Snapshot preparation and context setup
- `.oppie-hooks/mcts-post-execution.sh` - Learning, backpropagation, and cleanup

### 3. Integration Points Established
- **MCTS → AutoNav**: Bridge script coordinates Claude Code TDD workflows
- **AutoNav → Claude**: Enhanced @.claude/commands/otw/research-tdd-pr-review with MCTS context
- **Claude → Helios**: Performance benchmarks feed MCTS learning system
- **Helios → MCTS**: Snapshot creation/backtrack based on results

### 4. Learning System
- Pattern recognition for similar development scenarios
- Reward calculation based on test results, coverage, and performance
- Automatic backtracking on failures with state restoration

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Choices
- Preserved universal installer strategy from ADR-001
- Updated domain references from autonav.ai to oppie.xyz
- Removed all internal dev path references for public readiness
- Maintained clean separation between MCTS orchestration, AutoNav coordination, and Claude Code execution

### Integration Strategy
- Bridge scripts coordinate between MCTS planner and execution environments
- Helios snapshots enable rapid A → A.1 transitions
- TDD workflows integrated with MCTS reward signals
- Pre/post execution hooks handle context and learning

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components
✅ MCTS workflow definitions
✅ Bridge script coordination logic
✅ Helios snapshot integration
✅ TDD integration with learning loops
✅ Pre/post execution hooks
✅ Context propagation between systems

### Ready for Next Phase
- Project architecture supports MCTS planner connection
- End-to-end testing of MCTS → AutoNav → Claude → Helios workflow
- Distributed MCTS deployments and cross-project learning

## Files Modified/Created

### New Directories
- `.mcts/` - MCTS workflow orchestration
- `.mcts/workflows/` - Execution workflow definitions

### Enhanced Components
- `.oppie-hooks/` - MCTS pre/post execution integration
- `CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md` - Updated with completion status
- Universal installer and AutoNav functionality preserved

### Key Integration Files
- `mcts-autonav-bridge.sh` - Main coordination script
- `helios-snapshot-execution.md` - Core transition workflow
- `mcts-tdd-integration.md` - TDD learning integration
- `mcts-pre-execution.sh` - Context setup and preparation
- `mcts-post-execution.sh` - Learning and cleanup

## Context for Future Sessions

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Connect actual MCTS planner to bridge scripts
2. End-to-end testing of complete workflow
3. Validate snapshot creation and restoration
4. Test learning feedback loops

### Long-term Objectives
- Multi-project MCTS knowledge sharing
- Performance optimization of snapshot transitions
- Advanced reward function development
- Cross-team collaboration features

### Architecture Benefits
- Universal project compatibility through AutoNav
- Rapid iteration through Helios snapshots
- Intelligent learning through MCTS backpropagation
- Clean separation of concerns across components
