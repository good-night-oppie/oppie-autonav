write_memory("research_tdd_active", task_id)
write_memory("research_findings_[task_id]", findings)
write_memory("test_strategy_[task_id]", strategy)
write_memory("validation_results_[task_id]", results)
```

## Boundaries

**Will:**
- Enforce mandatory research phase for all tasks

- Ignore security findings from research

## Integration with TaskMaster

```bash
# Automatic triggers
task-master set-status --id=X --status=in-progress
â†’ Triggers /otw/research-tdd-implementation X

# Progress tracking
task-master update-subtask --id=X.Y --prompt="[phase results]"

# Completion
task-master set-status --id=X --status=done
```
